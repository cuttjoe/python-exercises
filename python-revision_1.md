## Mathematical operations

1. calculate the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle with sides 6 and 7 cm
 

def question1():
	a=6**2
	b=7**2
	hyp=a+b
	real=hyp**0.5
	print (real)
def question2():
	print(17//5)
def question3():
	for i in range (1,75):
		if i%7==0:
			print(i)
def question4():
	d=7
	print(d)
	for i in range (1,100):
		d=d+7
		print(d)
def exstra():
	for i in range (2,100):
		if i/7==i//7:
			print (i)

## Input /output
5. Ask user for a number and a name  
    Now print the name with as many spaces between the letters  
    Also print the name as may times as the number
5. Ask user for a name and print name one letter at a time (separate lines)  
	Now print the letters diagonally across the page one letter at a time (separate lines)
6. Figure out how to print this pattern below with and without using a loop (its just a formatting trick)

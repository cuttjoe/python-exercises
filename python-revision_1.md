# Python Revision 1
## Mathematical operations  
/ + - % // %
1. calculate the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle with sides 6 and 7 cm
1. what does 
```python
print(17//5)
```
get you and why?  

3. Print all numbers below 75 dividable by 7
1. Now do it without using modular division

## Input /output
5. Ask user for a number and a name  
    Now print the name with as many spaces between the letters  
    Also print the name as may times as the number
5. Ask user for a name and print name one letter at a time (separate lines)  
	Now print the letters diagonally across the page one letter at a time (separate lines)
6. Figure out how to print this pattern below with and without using a loop (its just a formatting trick)  
```

ex1: 

a=6
b=7
c=a*a+b*b
print (c)
d=(c ** 0.5)
print (d)



ex2:

a=17
b=5
c=a//b
print(c)


ex3:

x=75%7
print(x)
